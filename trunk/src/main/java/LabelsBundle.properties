cam.tilt.microwave.desc=Microwave Tilt: Current trip alarm sensor pan angle in degrees. An angle of 181 indicates the camera will maintain it's position when the alarm is triggered.
gate.conf=Gate Configuration
gate.toggle=Toogles gate access. When disabled the gate will not open regardless of key code entry using a remote control.
gate.state=Gate State (open/close)
gate.toggle.desc=Toogles opening/closing gate
gate.toggle.failed=Failed to open/close gate for %1$s node(s). See log for more details.
camgate=Camera/Gate
sensors=Sensors
cam.take.qvga=Takes a QVGA image at the current camera pan/tilt angle and transfers the image back to the host. An email with the attached image will also be sent when enabled.
cam.take.vga=Takes a VGA image at the current camera pan/tilt angle and transfers the image back to the host. An email with the attached image will also be sent when enabled.
settings.send=Sends the settings to the remote microcontroller node. Blinks when settings updates have been made, but have not yet been sent.
sensors.readings.get=Gets the current sensor readings and updates the readings display with the values.
sensors.trip.multi=Multi-alarm trip state. When any combination of sensors have been selected those selected sensors will ALL have to be tripped in order to cause an alarm. When NONE of the sensors have been selected ANY sensor trip will cause an alarm. Keep in mind that the sensors selected should be on or no alarm will be triggered.
sensors.readings=Readings
reload=Reload
all=All
sensors.readings.failed=Unable to get the sensor readings from node %1$s. See log for more details.
settings.send.failed=Unable to send the settings to the %1$s node(s). See log for more details.
